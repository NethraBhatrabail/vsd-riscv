* Task 1 : Installed Ubuntu through VirtualBox. Wrote a  c code to find sum of 1 to n numbers and through riscv found the number of instruction executed.
* Task 2 : This repository contains a simple C program compiled using the RISC-V GCC compiler with two different optimization levels: -O1 and -Ofast. The compiled program was executed in the SPIKE RISC-V simulator, and object dumps were collected to analyze the impact of optimizations on instruction execution and performance.
* Task 3 : From the riscv-objdump of my application code, identifed 15 unique RISC-V instructions.
For those 15 instructions, determined the exact 32-bit instruction code in their respective instruction type ( R, I, S, B, U, and J)formats.
* Task 4 : Performed the functional simulation experiment using RISC-V core:Verilog netlist and testbench and then observed the waveform. A brief introduction and waveforms is listed in the pdf.
* Task 5 : It incluides project idea , overview, pinout and circuit diagram, connection table.
* Task 6 : It includes final code submission and application demo. I have used Arduino IDE to upload the code to VSD chip by installing the CH32V board. I have also installed WCH-link drive in my system which is essential for getting the output. Here is my drive link which contains demo of this application,

* I would like to thank Kunal Gosh sir for providing such a useful mini intership where I have learnt so many things about RISC-V.
